    "* Timing formats and systems different from JD TDB. For example, you can specify that your data is in JD with UTC timing system. If you do not specify the timing system, the code will default to UTC and will automatically correct for barycentric light travel time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <small> NOTE: If you choose to specify a different timing format and/or systems, or if you choose not to specify the timing system, REMEMBER the code will automatically convert your time to JD TDB timing format and system. If this happens, you will need to include some additional information including the position of your object in the sky (in RA and Dec) and the position of your observing location on Earth (in longitude and latitude). You ARE REQUIRED to input the coordinates of your object. You ARE NOT REQUIRED to specify your location on Earth, but this will generate a default position on Earth that corresponds to the North Pole.</small>\n",
    "\n",
    "* No mid-time uncertainties. In this case, a placeholder list of 1s will be generated for functional purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No list specifying transits and occultations. If you do not include a list specifying if the data included is a transit or occultation (this will be the tra_or_occ parameter), then the code defaults to transits and will generate a list of 'tra' that has a number of values equal to the number of values of your epochs array.\n",
