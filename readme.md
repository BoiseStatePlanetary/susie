## Statement of need
The authors should clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its relation to other work.

## Installation instructions
Software dependencies should be clearly documented and their installation handled by an automated procedure. Where possible, software installation should be managed with a package manager. For example, Python packages should be pip installable, and have adopted packaging conventions.

TODO: Document how to pip install, go over the other packages that will be installed with the package.

## Example usage
The authors should include examples of how to use the software (ideally to solve real-world analysis problems).

TODO: This will probably somehow be pulled from a notebook, we can also include some graphs and stuff.

## API documentation
Reviewers should check that the software API is documented to a suitable level.

## Community guidelines
There should be clear guidelines for third-parties wishing to:

Contribute to the software
Report issues or problems with the software
Seek support
